## Summary

The Book and Document Distrubution Tool or referred to as BDDT for easier
recognition is our team proposal project that our group would liketo research
and build. 

## How it works
The BDDT involves various steps from uploading to keeing a correct format. The
user will submit a document that they wish to upload to our server. We then
submit the document to the webpage that can be accessed to anyone with an 
Internet connection. As the document is uploaded to our webserver, our code 
will format parse out the input we want. The goal right now is to grab the 
text we want to display and remove the images (for the time being). We would
expect our audience to use mobile devices than a computer for reading 
especially those out in the field. The document will then be on display using
basic HTML and formatted correctly to where anyone who reads the corresponding
document won't suffer from eye strain.

## Audience
This app is designed to help those who live in rural areas without fast 
internet connections. Compared to the rest of the world, other places have
to rely on speeds that can take hours to grab information let alone documents.
We hope to submit documentes containing educational materials but lack the 
infrastructure to keep browsing for content consistently. 

We also expect our audience to expand to others working in such countries who
may need to download manuals or references pertaining to their job at hand.
They may not have the coverage to watch video tutorials relating to their 
cubject at hand but can at least pull out a document.

## Front End questions

We want our front end to look as dynamically pleasant as possible wihtout 
causing a lack of time on already poor internet functions. The basics of HTMl
we want with a spalsh of a pleasing interface.

## Back End Quesitons
What will we need to do regarding various file formats that are uploaded? Will
we have the user only upload certain file formats or will we develop seperate
functions? Can a user scan a copy of their text and upload it to where we can
grab the information we need?

## Biggest Questions
What we have discovered going over the project iswhat we will need to do
for parsing and formatting the material ranging from Word, PDF, and manual 
copy paste text. Are we able to have different submit functions that can parse
out images or anything containing an image that won't alter the document
too badly?

How are we going to host the website? Since the files we are dealing with are
only text documents, we don't have to worry too much regarding space
capacity.
