# Agile User Story Template for BDDT

## Summary

As we developed our code design and how we would like to implement our project, we focused on a core audience. Based on what we want developed for our group, we have a following population that would find our website valuable.

- Educators/ students in rural areas.
- Crew members working in areas without tremendous internet coverage (army members, mechanic crews needing a manual).
- New authors/ academic writers
- Avid readers in slow-connection areas wanting a diverse selection.

Based on the following criteria, we are developing our code design based on user criteria below:

## User Stories

I want to read textbooks online with a clear format,
so that my eyes do not strain while trying to read the
text.

my students what they need to understand without digging

out.

so that users can get an understanding of what they will read before
diving in.

-  As a textbook author, I want to upload my textbook from
scans and see the text formatted clearly, so that I can save
time and ease uploading scans.

#### Generic Users

- As a generic user, I want to be able to upload any document
extension, so that I don't have to worry about converting any
text and it still appears the same.

- As a generic end user on a slower internet connection, I want to be able 
to see a directory, so that I can see the selections of all uploads included

- As a generic end user, I want to see the most recent uploaded documents,
so that i can be sure if I uploaded a document recently, it will be there

- As a generic end user, I want to be able to search a directory by different
parameters, so that I can find a document that I'm looking for
but cannot remember the specifications

- As a generic end user with a decent internet connection, I want to be able
to see a more dynamic version of the website, so that the frontend looks
pleasing to me while i search for documents
