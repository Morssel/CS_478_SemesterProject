// Github wouldn't allow me to upload this file by itself,
// (The file size was too large, and I wasn't sure how to trim it down).
// So, here's a link to it in Google Drive:
// https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YrOj50fuF727I6pPqFHs5G-S6WF5pbin
// This folder includes the basic HTML code I have so far,
// As well as a mock-up SQL database in order for me to test private/public filters and doctype filters.
